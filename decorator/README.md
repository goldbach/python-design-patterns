## Decorator pattern

*NOTE* Python has decorators in its language. You can at compile time wrap functions and classes. The Decorator pattern is a different beast as we shall see.

In the Decorator pattern, an object has an object and is an object. 

The HFDP uses a crazy example of a Starbuzz coffee shop. Weird example as noone would make a coffee shop like this (requirering a re-compile when adding new products) but useful for showing the mechanics of the Decorator pattern.

`coffee1.py` is more HFDP look alike, while `coffee2.py` is a IMHO more Pythonic version.
